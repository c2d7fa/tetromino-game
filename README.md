# Tetromino Game

This is an implementation of a Tetromino-based action-puzzle game, made in Godot.

I made this as a project to learn about [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), and
to challenge myself to actually make and "release" a more or less fully-fledged
game. This is my first time working with Godot, and as a result the code is
pretty bad; I would not recommend using this project to learn how to use
Godot. I probably won't be updating this project.

Still, I wanted to release something as part of this project, so feel free to
check it out if you are interested.

Building it requires Godot: You just need to import the project into Godot from
the Project Manager.
